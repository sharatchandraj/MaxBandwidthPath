# MaxBandwidthPath
Max Bandwidth path implementation using modified Dijkstra's and Kruskal's algorithms


The project has 7 python files
- DijkstrasNoHeap.py - Has the routines for the dijkstra's algorithm (without implementing a heap)
- DijkstrasWithHeap.py - Has the routines for the dijkstra's algorithm (with the implementation of a heap)
- Kruskals.py - Has the routines for the Kruskal's algorithm 
- MaxHeap.py - Has the routines for the max heap
- HeapSortForKruskals.py - Has the HeapSort routines for Kruskal's algorithm
- GraphGeneration.py - Has the routines to generate the sparse and dense graphs
- driver.py - The driver code to generate the graphs, run the routing algorithms and print the running times for all iterations

Please run the driver.py file with Python3.

Note - I have added the output from my one of my runs in this folder. (driverOutput.txt)
